# Django Wagtail Blog

This is an implementation of the Wagtail CMS 'first website' guide on the Wagtail documentation, as a reference, with some added features.

I've also added:

1. A simple menu using page hierarchy, to the 'base.html' template.
2. A dynamic blog search page to see how Vue.js plays with Wagtail.
3. Bootstrap - to lay out some grid templates.

Instead of creating a SPA and setting up a REST API, I only wanted to implement Vue.js with some of the pages in the application.
I wanted to see how Bootstrap and Vue.js get along with Wagtail.
